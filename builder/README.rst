Mansion Generation
==================

Specification
-------------

The resultant "mansion" is defined as something one might find in an Agatha
Christie novel. Obviously, the generation needn't be limited to such a specific
scope, but initially this seems to be a good target.

Some examples of what the resultant manor house should look like:

1. `Dixton Manor`_. (Link to PDFs).
2. `Stepne Manor`_. (PDF)
3. `Trewince Manor`_. (PDF)
