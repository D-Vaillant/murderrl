Console layer is the fundamental thing: it's where things get printed on. This is a running description of what's going on, as far as I can tell.

A lot of this is happening in `interface` obviously but it also relies on some stuff in `library`.

interface
    screen.py

Grid: Matrix with some helper methods.
    init: takes height, width. outer list is height, inner lists are width.
    at: ?
    get: ?

library
    coord.py

CoordError: homespun baby

RectangleIterator
    Abstraction.

AdjacencyIterator
    Extends rectangle iterator.
