Manor building

* Some of the neighbour rooms don't work well together.

  This is more of FR, but sometimes two adjacent rooms really don't work
  well together. This is most apparent if a bedroom is adjoining another
  (passage) room, and especially if said room is part of the utility
  section. Utility rooms as passage rooms to domestic rooms in general
  strike me as odd. I once had a string of connected rooms leading from
  pantry > smoking room > kitchen > corridor. I liked having the pantry
  close to the kitchen, but the smoking room in-between was really out of
  place. Smoked food works somewhat differently... ;)
