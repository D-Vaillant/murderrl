MurderRL

**A rogue-like murder mystery game in Python.**

Support and Documentation
=========================

Documentation can be found in the ``doc/`` sub-directory. A complete index
sorted by module can be found in ``doc/index.rst``, while per-module
documentation can be found in ``doc/<module>.rst``.

You can access the documentation for trunk on-line via github's wonderful
rst2html conversion:

- `Index`_
 - `coord module`_
 - `shape module`_
 - `database module`_
 - `docparser module`_

*Nota bene: Due to limitations of github, anchors are suppressed, therefore
internal hyperlink sare non-functioning. You can view the complete but possibly
outdated documentation at the* `MurderRL page`_ *on github pages.*

General information
===================

MurderRL is a rogue-like in the vein of the seminal Rogue_, `Dungeon Crawl
Stone Soup`_, and NetHack_. Unlike these it is not a role-playing game;
instead, it is a "whodunnit" in the style of Agatha Christie many "country
house" mysteries, the `Gosford Park`_, and so on.

Like the aforementioned rogue-likes, the plot of the game, the characters, the
setting and the location will be completely randomised [#]_. This means that the game
is infinitely replayable.

The game will feature varying difficulty levels and a large pool of random
information. While you may encounter similarly named characters or find a clue
that you've seen before, you can know for certain that their role in previous
games is unrelated to the current one.

Installation and usage
