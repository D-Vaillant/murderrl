MurderRL
********
**A rogue-like murder mystery game in Python.**

Support and Documentation
=========================

There currently isn't much in the way of documentation. What future
documentation will mainly exist as Python doc-strings and probably some
explanations of plot generation methodology.

General information
===================

MurderRL is a rogue-like in the vein of the seminal Rogue_, `Dungeon Crawl
Stone Soup`_, and NetHack_. Unlike these it is not a role-playing game;
instead, it is a "whodunnit" in the style of Agatha Christie many "country
house" mysteries, the `Gosford Park`_, and so on.

Like the aforementioned rogue-likes, the plot of the game, the characters, the
setting and the location will be completely randomised [#]_. This means that the game
is infinitely replayable.

The game will feature varying difficulty levels and a large pool of random
information. While you may encounter similarly named characters or find a clue
that you've seen before, you can know for certain that their role in previous
games is unrelated to the current one.

Installation and usage
======================

From source
-----------

    git clone git://github.com/jmcb/murderrl
    cd murderrl
    python game.py
